This is the README file for Tie::Hash::Array, Tie::Hash::Abbrev and
Tie::Hash::Abbrev::Smart, by Martin H. Sluka <perl@sluka.de>.

Tie::Hash::Array gives you hashes which are internally stored as
sorted arrays, therefore you will retrieve its contents in a defined
order and can use objects as keys if you like.

Tie::Hash::Abbrev is a subclass of Tie::Hash::Array, and allows you to
access the contents of tied hashes using unambiguously abbreviated
keys.

Tie::Hash::Abbrev::Smart, which sub-classes Tie::Hash::Abbrev.
Here an abbreviation is still considered unambiguous even if more than
one matching key exists, as long as all the corresponding values are
equal (that is, they are either all undefined or have identical string
representations).
